Live Demo
(Note: Backend is hosted on Render free tier, so initial load may be slow)

**Key Features:**

-  Create, edit, and delete blog posts

-  User authentication using JWT

-  Markdown support for post formatting

-  Clean separation of backend & frontend

-  Deployed on Netlify (frontend) and Render (backend)
